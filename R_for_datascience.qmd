```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggthemes)

#1. How many rows are in penguins? How many columns?
#ANSWER; 8 ROWS
palmerpenguins::penguins

#2. What does the bill_depth_mm variable in the penguins data frame describe?
#Read the help for ?penguins to find out.

#ANSWER: A NUMBER DENOTING THE BILL DEPTH IN MILLIMETERS!
?penguins

#3. Make a scatterplot of bill_depth_mm vs. bill_length_mm. Describe the 
#relationship between these two variables. 

ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point()
#Answer: The deeper the depth, the longer the length,

#4. What happens if you make a scatterplot of species vs bill_depth_mm? Why
#is the plot not useful?
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = species,
                y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point()
#Since species is a variable and it isnt linear so we can't get a relationship from the data


#5. Why does the following give an error and how would you fix it?
        #ggplot(data = penguins) +
#             geom_point()
#Answers: The x and y are not specified, just need to give it an x and y and it will be graphed. 

#6. What does the na.rm arguments do in geom_point()? What is the default value of
# the agrument? Create a scatterplot where you successfully use the argument set to
# TRUE.

#7. Add the following caption to the plot you made in the previous exercise:
# Data come from the palmerpenguins package." Hint: take a look at the documentation
# for labs().

#8. Recreate the following visualization. What aesthetic should bill_depth_mm be mapped to? 
# And should it be mapped at the global level or at the geom level.
